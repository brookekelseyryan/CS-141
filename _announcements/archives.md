Welcome! This is an archived course page and is no longer active (that must explain the ghosts in the sidebar...)

I served as the Teaching Assistant for this course in Fall 2021. This course page was not actively used while I taught, but I made it afterwards so that I can keep a repository of my old discussion materials and so that they could maybe get reused by future TAs. 

If you're a current Information Retrieval student, the Resources page will probably be helpful for you. Additionally, look at the Discussion page for a weekly breakdown of my materials. If you're a current student, I can't guarantee its up-to-date, of course. 

I also created a "mini Brooke syllabus" for my discussion sections. They probably didn't read it honestly, but it helped me stay organized! 

Hopefully this helps. I tried to dump everything I made here, but if you have any questions, please feel free to email me if you need to (brooke@brookekryan.com). 

Happy teaching! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
